## Run

```sh
love src
```

to generate FFT data

```sh
python fft/fft.py
```

> PS: Don't ask about the FFT code. It's dubious.

## Acknowledgements

I do not own any of the assets used in this game.

## TODO:

- Resize BLOCKED! text
- Fix death animation and sound
- Fix basic AI and passing logic
- Fix sprite scaling in character select
